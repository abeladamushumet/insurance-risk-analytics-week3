# Interim Report  
## Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

---

### Project Overview

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling for insurance risk analytics on a dataset from AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The goal is to optimize insurance premiums and predict claim severity using machine learning.

### Work Completed So Far

- **Data Collection:** Raw insurance claims and policy data gathered and stored in `data'.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed univariate and bivariate analysis using Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/eda.ipynb`).

---

### Next Steps

- Complete detailed feature engineering and selection.
- Build and tune advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Validate models using cross-validation and relevant metrics.
- Develop a dashboard for visualization and reporting.
- Finalize documentation and prepare the final project report.

---

### Challenges

- Handling missing and inconsistent data values.
- Balancing model complexity and interpretability.
- Ensuring reproducibility with proper version control.
